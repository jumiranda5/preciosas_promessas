        <item>For no word will be impossible with God.\n(Luke 1,37)</item>
        <item>Then Mary said: \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done to me according to your word.\"\n(Luke 1,38)</item>

        <item>Let love be without falseness: hating evil, clinging to what is good.\n(Romans 12,9)</item>
        <item>(…) loving one another with fraternal charity, surpassing one another in honor.\n(Romans 12,10)</item>
        <item>(…) in hope, rejoicing; in tribulation, enduring; in prayer, ever-willing;\n(Romans 12,12)</item>
        <item>(…) in hope, rejoicing; in tribulation, enduring; in prayer, ever-willing;\n(Romans 12,12)</item>
        <item>Bless those who are persecuting you: bless, and do not curse.\n(Romans 12,14)</item>
        <item>Rejoice with those who are rejoicing. Weep with those who are weeping.\n(Romans 12,15)</item>
        <item>Render to no one harm for harm. Provide good things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men.\n(Romans 12,17)</item>

        <item>Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing. Give thanks in everything. For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for all of you.\n(I Thessalonians 5,16–18)</item>
        <item>By faith, we understand the world to be fashioned by the Word of God, so that the visible might be made by the invisible.\n(Hebrews 11,3)</item>
        <item>By faith, the walls of Jericho collapsed, after being encircled for seven days.\n(Hebrews 11,30)</item>
        <item>Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not apparent.\n(Hebrews 11,1)</item>
        <item>But if anyone among you is in need of wisdom, let him petition God, who gives abundantly to all without reproach, and it shall be given to him.\n(James 1,5)</item>

        <item>Blessed is the man who suffers temptation. For when he has been proven, he shall receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him.\n(James 1,12)</item>

        <item>Every excellent gift and every perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor any shadow of alteration.\n(James 1,17)</item>
        <item>So let every man be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to anger.\n(James 1,19)</item>
        <item>For the anger of man does not accomplish the justice of God.\n(James 1,20)</item>

        <item>So be doers of the Word, and not listeners only, deceiving yourselves.\n(James 1,22)</item>
        <item>But if anyone considers himself to be religious, but he does not restrain his tongue, but instead seduces his own heart: such a one\'s religion is vanity.\n(James 1,26)</item>
        <item>So if you perfect the regal law, according to the Scriptures, \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\" then you do well.\n(James 2,8)</item>
        <item>My brothers, what benefit is there if someone claims to have faith, but he does not have works? How would faith be able to save him?\n(James 2,14)</item>
        <item>Do you see that faith was cooperating with his works, and that by means of works faith was brought to fulfillment?\n(James 2,22)</item>
        <item>Do you see that a man is justified by means of works, and not by faith alone?\n(James 2,24)</item>
        <item>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.\n(James 2,26)</item>
        <item>From the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so!\n(James 3,10)</item>
        <item>And so the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those who make peace.\n(James 3,18)</item>
        <item>You desire, and you do not have. You envy and you kill, and you are unable to obtain. You argue and you fight, and you do not have, because you do not ask.\n(James 4,2)</item>
        <item>You ask and you do not receive, because you ask badly, so that you may use it toward your own desires.\n(James 4,3)</item>
        <item>But he gives a greater grace. Therefore he says: \"God resists the arrogant, but he gives grace to the humble.\"\n(James 4,6)</item>
        <item>Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.\n(James 4,10)</item>
        <item>Brothers, do not choose to slander one another. Whoever slanders his brother, or whoever judges his brother, slanders the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.\n(James 4,11)</item>
        <item>There is one lawgiver and one judge. He is able to destroy, and he is able to set free.\n(James 4,12)</item>
        <item>Therefore, he who knows that he ought to do a good thing, and does not do it, for him it is a sin.\n(James 4,17)</item>
        <item>Brothers, do not complain against one another, so that you may not be judged. Behold, the judge stands before the door.\n(James 5,9)</item>
        <item>My brothers, consider the Prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of departing from evil, of labor, and of patience.\n(James 5,10)</item>
        <item>Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he even-tempered? Let him sing psalms.\n(James 5,13)</item>
        <item>Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be saved. For the unremitting prayer of a just person prevails over many things.\n(James 5,16)</item>
        <item>Therefore, set aside all malice and all deceitfulness, as well as falseness and envy and every detraction.\n(1 Peter 2,1)</item>
        <item>Like newborn infants, desire the milk of reasonableness without guile, so that by this you may increase unto salvation,if it is true that you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.\n(1 Peter 2,2–3)</item>
        <item>For such is the will of God, that by doing good you may bring about the silence of imprudent and ignorant men.\n(1 Peter 2,15)</item>
        <item>Honor everyone. Love brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.\n(1 Peter 2,17)</item>
        <item>And finally, may you all be of one mind: compassionate, loving brotherhood, merciful, meek, humble, (…)\n(1 Peter 3,8)</item>
        <item>(…) not repaying evil with evil, nor slander with slander, but, to the contrary, repaying with blessings. For to this you have been called, so that you may possess the inheritance of a blessing.\n(1 Peter 3,9)</item>
        <item>For whoever wants to love life and to see good days should restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips, so that they utter no deceit.\n(1 Peter 3,10)</item>
        <item>Let him turn away from evil, and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it.\n(1 Peter 3,11)</item>
        <item>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears are with their prayers, but the countenance of the Lord is upon those who do evil.\n(1 Peter 3,12)</item>
        <item>And yet, even when you suffer something for the sake of justice, you are blessed. So then, do not be afraid with their fear, and do not be disturbed.\n(1 Peter 3,14)</item>
        <item>And so, be humbled under the powerful hand of God, so that he may exalt you in the time of visitation.\n(1 Peter 5,6)</item>
        <item>Cast all your cares upon him, for he takes care of you.\n(1 Peter 5,7)</item>
        <item>Fear is not in love. Instead, perfect love casts out fear, for fear pertains to punishment. And whoever fears is not perfected in love.\n(1 John 4,18)</item>
        <item>Whoever declares himself to be in the light, and yet hates his brother, is in the darkness even now.\n(1 John 2,9)</item>
        <item>And this is the confidence which we have toward God: that no matter what we shall request, in accord with his will, he hears us.\n(1 John 5,14)</item>
        <item>And we know that he hears us, no matter what we request; so we know that we can obtain the things that we request of him.\n(1 John 5,15)</item>
        <item>If I were to speak in the language of men, or of Angels, yet not have charity, I would be like a clanging bell or a crashing cymbal.\n(1 Corinthians 13,1)</item>
        <item>And if I have prophecy, and learn every mystery, and obtain all knowledge, and possess all faith, so that I could move mountains, yet not have charity, then I am nothing.\n(1 Corinthians 13,2)</item>
        <item>And if I distribute all my goods in order to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, yet not have charity, it offers me nothing.\n(1 Corinthians 13,3)</item>
        <item>Charity is patient, is kind. Charity does not envy, does not act wrongly, is not inflated.\n(1 Corinthians 13,4)</item>
        <item>Charity is never torn away, even if prophecies pass away, or languages cease, or knowledge is destroyed.\n(1 Corinthians 13,8)</item>
        <item>For just as the Passion of Christ abounds in us, so also, through Christ, does our consolation abound.\n(2 Corinthians 1,5)</item>
        <item>And God said, \"Let there be light.\" And light became.\n(Genesis 1,3)</item>
        <item>And God saw the light, that it was good; and so he divided the light from the darknesses.\n(Genesis 1,4)</item>
        <item>And I will be your guardian wherever you will journey, and I will bring you back into this land. Neither will I dismiss you, until I have accomplished all that I have said.\n(Genesis 28,15)</item>
        <item>And Moses said to the people: \"Do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the great wonders of the Lord, which he will do today.\"\n(Exodus 14,13)</item>
        <item>The Lord will fight on your behalf, and you will remain silent.\n(Exodus 14,14)</item>
        <item>Behold, I will send my Angel, who will go before you, and preserve you on your journey, and lead you into the place that I have prepared.\n(Exodus 23,20)</item>
        <item>(…) Just as I was with Moses, so will I be with you. I will not leave you, nor will I forsake you.\n(Joshua 1,5)</item>
        <item>Behold, I am instructing you. Be strengthened, and be steadfast. Do not dread, and do not fear. For the Lord your God is with you in all things, wherever you may go.\n(Joshua 1,9)</item>
        <item>And Joshua said to the people: \"Be sanctified. For tomorrow the Lord will accomplish miracles among you.\"\n(Joshua 3,5)</item>
        <item>But all who worship you are certain of this: that one’s life, if it should be tested, shall be crowned, and if it should be in tribulation, shall be delivered, and if it should be corrected, shall be permitted to approach your mercy.\n(Tobit 3,21)</item>
        <item>For you are not delighted with our perdition. For, after a storm, you create tranquility, and after tears and weeping, you pour out exultation.\n(Tobit 3,22)</item>
        <item>Never permit arrogance to rule in your mind or in your words. For in it, all perdition had its beginning.\n(Tobit 4,14)</item>
        <item>Whatever you would hate to have done to you by another, see that you never do so to another.\n(Tobit 4,16)</item>
        <item>Bless God at all times. And petition him that he direct your ways and that all your counsels may remain in him.\n(Tobit 4,20)</item>
        <item>And the young man said to him, \"Be steadfast in soul. Your cure from God is near.\"\n(Tobit 5,13)</item>
        <item>For it is good to conceal the secret of a king, just as it is also honorable to reveal and to confess the works of God.\n(Tobit 12,7)</item>
        <item>(…) and he said, \"Naked I departed from my mother’s womb, and naked I shall return. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. Just as it pleased the Lord, so has it been done. Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"\n(Job 1,21)</item>
        <item>He does great and unfathomable and miraculous things without number.\n(Job 5,9)</item>
